conceptName: DutySync
problemSolved: A common, pervasive problem in military units is the inefficient and often inequitable manual management of duty rosters, typically handled through outdated spreadsheets or paper schedules. This approach leads to significant administrative burdens for leaders, consuming valuable time that should be spent on training or mission planning, while simultaneously introducing human error that results in double-booking or missed shifts. Furthermore, without an automated system to track duty hours and qualifications, ensuring the fair distribution of undesirable weekend or overnight duties becomes a subjective challenge, leading to diminished troop morale and perceptions of unfairness that ultimately detract from unit readiness and cohesion.
