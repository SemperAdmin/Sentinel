conceptName: Electronic Document Management System (EDMS)
problemSolved: An Electronic Document Management System (EDMS) solves the critical problems associated with paper-based and disorganized digital file storage, primarily by eliminating inefficient manual processes, mitigating security and compliance risks, and ensuring rapid access to mission-critical information. By providing a centralized, indexed, and secure repository with version control and automated workflows, an EDMS drastically reduces the time personnel spend searching for documents, prevents accidental loss or unauthorized modification of records, and ensures regulatory adherence by maintaining clear audit trails and enforcing consistent retention policies, thereby improving operational efficiency, accountability, and decision-making speed across the organization.
